# Time and relative dimensions in spatial tensors
*A study on the impacts of covariates and deep learning techniques on time series forecasting*

----

A 2022/3 project investigating the relationship between covariate presence and deep learning techniques on the domain of crime forecasting.
> In this study, performed in the domain of spatiotemporal crime forecasting, two binary variables are isolated: the presence within input data tensor T of crime-agnostic social covariate data; and the use of deep learning techniques in the modelling process. The focus of the study is upon the interaction between the values of these two variables, and how careful choices thereof can influence both the accuracy and mean bias—with ideal values of which dictated by the desired behaviour of the resultant model.
A priority is also held throughout the study for making careful and responsible choices in design in order to minimise the risk of bias within created models, as mitigation of the potential social and ethical complications of spatial crime forecasting is deemed paramount.
